# KonLab-Programs
Python and Bash Programs Used Frequently in Konermann Lab

The programs contained within this repository have been tested to work on my personal files for my needs.
I encourage other to  try these programs out for their own use and modify them as needed.
If you have a suggestion for a specific program, contact me and we can work to include updates to improve usability.

My aim with these programs is to create a set of programs that are generalizable enough to work in a variety of use case scenarios.
This meaning I intend to have programs that can automate as much of the parameterization process as possible with as little input from the user as required.
